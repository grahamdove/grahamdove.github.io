                <h3>Assistant Professor<br/>
		People+Technology Lab<br />
                New York Univeristy, Tandon School of Engineering<br />
                Dept. of Technology Management and Innovation<br />

                <p>
                    I am a human-computer interaction researcher and interaction designer. My research in the People+Technology lab focuses on human-centered and participatory design approaches to A.I., and to creating data-rich products, services, and artifacts. I am interested in applications in areas such as: <i>healthcare</i>, where I have been designing with clinicians who treat neurological diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS); <i>community science and health advocacy</i>, where I have been working with communities in NYC Chinatowns around noise and air quality concerns with a focus on the environmental impacts of the reconstruction of Manhattan Jail; <i>digital civics</i>, where I have been working with NYC MODA and BetaNYC to look at informal learning around community use of open data; and <i>design for A.I. and machine learning</i>, where I have been investigating design metaphors and new methods for ideating and prototyping. I am jointly academic director of the Human-Centered Technology, Innovation and Design PhD program at NYU Tandon, and teach courses in digital civics and designing A.I. innovation. Reach out if you are interested in learning more, collaborating, or joining my lab as a student.

                <p>
                    Prior to joining NYU, I was a member of the Center for Participatory Information Technology at Aarhus University, Denmark. My PhD, titled <a class="paper" href="papers/codesignwithdata.pdf">CoDesign with Data</a>, was completed in 2015 whilst working jointly in the Centre for Human Computer Interaction Design and the Centre for Creativity in Professional Practice, at City University of London. My research bridges design studies, human-computer interaction, creativity studies, and data science to explore methods for understanding human-data relations and collaboratively designing pleasurable and meaningful products and services. Prior to focusing on an academic career I worked on digital design and streaming media projects in the live music industry.
